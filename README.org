#+TITLE: Incident Management and Response Tools

* Overview
  I have a large number of systems, security, operations, and otherwise with some role in the incident management process.  They sit there, blinking lights at each other, but none of them communicate.  The scripts in this directory aim to fix that, likely in the most superficial way possible.
  This repository is a set of scripts I have created and use for performing incident management activities.  To me, this covers everything from vulnerability analysis to open source research to incident response activities, and as a result, this is a pretty varied toolset.

However, this is fairly tailored to my own workflows and tools, so you
may not be able to run it directly out-of-the-box.  I hope these are
of some use.

** Preparing your envionment
   Most things can be run straight away or with slight modification to the code itself.  However, some of the scripts ahve configuration settings and they default to looking in ~/.incmgmt for relevant configuration files


* The Scripts
  The scripts and toolsin this repository are organized into folders by use or purpose.  

** Vulnerability Analysis and Management
   Located in ./VulnMgmt
   Scripts to help implement a vulnerability management program

*** Vuln-tickets.py
    This creates tickets on both Redmine[fn:1] and Service Now[fn:2] ticketing systems so that operational teams can work on the issues.

** Research
   Located in ./Research
  Random scripts for log mining, intel gathering, network querying,
  and other incident response-ish activities.  Unless otherwise
  indicated, all files in this project are governed by the GPLv3
  license.  
*** ioc-intel.sh
    This script performs some quick lookups against a list of ip
    address or FQDN IOCs
*** reverselook.sh
    performs reverse lookups on a list of IP addresses
*** cif-lookup.sh
    performs lookups on multiple cif servers and reports on hit or no
hit cif servers are based on local user's .cif* files
